## ⚠️ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying authentication features:
- [ ] Verify all authentication endpoints work locally
- [ ] Test database connection and user creation
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing tickets
- [ ] Test login/logout flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify role-based permissions work correctly

## 🆘 Emergency Rollback Plan

If authentication deployment causes issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git checkout backup-before-auth-v2
   git push --force-with-lease origin main
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback** (keep some features):
   - Restore specific files from backup branch
   - Commit selective changes
   - Deploy incrementally

3. **Database Rollback**:
   - User management tables can be dropped without affecting tickets
   - Customer data and tickets remain intact
